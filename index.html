      <ol>
        <li>The chosen interface is a vending machine in the lobby of the library.</li>
        <li>There are several interview questions I designed which 
          I have saved for the observations section.
        </li>
        <li>Pictured: a rough sketch of the vending machine's functions

    </div>

    <div id="observations">
      <h1>Observations</h1>
      <p>Some of the interesting observations I made are listed below.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Some people swipe their credit card first. Perhaps they don't care about price?</li>
        <li>In order to get two items, one has to make two separate payments.</li>
        <li>Other users went straight for the buttons to check the price of items.</li>
        <li>One user had trouble for the payment to go through. 
          This user clicked buttons and tapped credit card several times before item was deposited</li>
        <li>Users who clicked numbers first to check prices had to tap their card 
          and then click the numbers again to get their product. 
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>I also devised several questions to ask users about their own experiences. Here are the results:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Given the layout of the machine, what would you do first?
          <ul>
            <li>Look for the desired item first, asking the question "what do I want?"</li>
            <li>Tap card on the credit card machine</li>
            <li>Insert numbers to check price of desired items</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>How would you go about looking for the price of items?
          <ul>
            <li>Insert the numbers corresponding to the item I want</li>
            <li>Some vending machines have physical price tags listed below the items, 
              so some users are used to looking at the item first.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>How do you pay for the item? 
          <ul>
            <li>Tap my card on the credit card reader and select the item</li>
            <li>Select item and then tap credit card on the reader</li>
            <li>Most users seemed to not carry cash â€” no one used cash to pay.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Is it clear to you how you would use the machine?
          <ul>
            <li>Some users felt that it was confusing that the prices weren't listed directly.</li>
            <li>Some said it was moderately clear: the credit card reader 
              has a very small display that says "swipe or tap to begin."</li>
            <li>Others felt there was an initial adjustment process because they were
               used to using other types of vending machines.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>

        <li>What are some frustrations you have with the machine?
          <ul>
            <li>Price-conscious users felt that not having prices directly listed was frustrating</li>
            <li>Others felt that it's never very clear whether one should pay first or select item first.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>

        <li>What do you like about the interface?
          <ul>
            <li>Shorter users can get snacks from the top row without having to reach it by themselves.</li>
            <li>Item numbers are clearly listed.</li>
            <li>Buttons for selecting items are easy to press.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>In what situations would you use this?
          <ul>For a snack: a little hungry but no time to go to a restaurant.</ul>
          <ul>Busy, in a rush.</ul>
          <ul>Studying late night at the library.</ul>
        </li>
      </ol>
